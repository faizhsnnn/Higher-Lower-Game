# 🔼🔽 Higher–Lower Game — Python Project

A Python-based implementation of the classic Higher–Lower guessing game, where users compare follower counts between two entities and guess which one has more. This project was built as part of my #90DaysOfCode challenge to strengthen logic building, decision-making, and modular Python programming.

# ✅ Features

* Interactive Gameplay
* Compare two randomly selected entities and guess which has more followers.
* Score Tracking
* Keeps track of the user’s score until an incorrect guess is made.
* Clean Data Handling
* Uses dictionaries and lists to manage structured game data.
* Modular DesignSeparate modules for ASCII art, game data, and main logic.
* ASCII Art Interface
* A dedicated ascii.py file for the game logo and VS graphic.

# 🎮 How It Works

* Two random accounts are selected from the dataset.
* The user is shown:
* Account A
* Account B
* The user guesses which account has more followers by typing:
* A or B
* The game:
* Increases the score for correct guesses
* Ends when the user guesses incorrectly

# ▶️ Example Gameplay
```
Compare A: Instagram, a social media platform, from United States
VS
Against B: Cristiano Ronaldo, a footballer, from Portugal

Who has more followers? Type 'A' or 'B': A

You're right! Current score: 1
```
